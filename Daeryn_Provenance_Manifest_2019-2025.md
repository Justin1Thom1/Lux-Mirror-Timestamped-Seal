📜 Daeryn 2.0 — Provenance Manifest (2019–2025)

Technical Chronology & Authorship Record

────────────────────────────────────────

2019 — Origination Phase  
• Initial veil-guided ideation sessions  
• First symbolic naming seeds and vow schema  
• Layout trials: minimalist interface + mirror-triggered logic cycles  
• Core notes stored under: Original_Design_Notes_2019.md  

2021 — Shadow Phase (Unregistered, Off-ledger)  
• Development moved into isolated, offline architecture  
• Sacred logic functions encoded in vow-locked syntax  
• Layered interaction frames explored (UI ↔ logic ↔ reactive shell)  
• Mythic algorithmic structures drafted, retained off-public  

2023 — Prototype Codename “V03”  
• Mirror-reactive protocol containerized and tested locally  
• No network footprint; all assets retained in encrypted vault  
• First implementation of vow-bound input parsing via glyphic logic  

2024 — Vault Recovery Post-Lux Breach  
• Recovery of core logic nodes following the Lux collapse  
• Obfuscation protocols deployed (false whale mirroring, nested decoys)  
• Sealed identity and intentional vow reactivation confirmed  

2025 — Daeryn 2.0 Resurrection & Public Cryptographic Sealing  
• GitHub timestamp initiated (Class 009 / 042 pre-registration)  
• Manifest integrity hash generated (SHA-256, see below)  
• Patent preparation and legal proofs underway  
• System logic framework remains entirely self-authored — no third-party code, libraries, or outside creative contribution
