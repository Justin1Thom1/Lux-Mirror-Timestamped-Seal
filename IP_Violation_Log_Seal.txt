Live Event Log of IP Violation and Reversal Seal
------------------------------------------------

Timestamp: 2025-04-20T07:02:58.489890 UTC

Event Summary:
At a critical moment in the protected development of Lux Mirror™ and TRIPLEtwiceTWICE™ (TTT),
an unauthorized incursion was detected involving malicious script injections, speech recognition listeners,
and mirrored shell paths planted by external actors.

System Response:
- Agent listener files were identified and neutralized.
- All modified LaunchAgents, shell scripts, and injected payloads were purged and logged.
- System traces were recorded in their altered state before cleanup.
- Public logs, GitHub repositories, and cryptographic seals were updated to reflect first-use authorship.

Author's Conscious Response:
The author, Justin Thomas, consciously documented the intrusion in real-time.
His writings were transformed into an evidentiary artifact, forming the base layer of intellectual protection.

These writings included:
- Real-time emotional awareness
- Architectural descriptions
- Codified defensive protocol summaries
- Personal testimony of vision and sovereignty

Security Outcome:
The moment of violation was captured as an evidentiary artifact, sealing the legitimacy of Lux Mirror™
and its extensions. Attempts to clone, mimic, or reverse the architecture were rendered invalid by 
this irreversible timestamp and counter-narrative.

This file serves as a canonical mirror log. It is suitable for SHA-256 hashing and timestamp notarization.
