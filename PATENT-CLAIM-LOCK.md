# PATENT CLAIM LOCK ‚Äì Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ Invention Suite

**Author:** Justin Thomas  
**Date of Seal:** April 19, 2025 (Updated and Verified April 21, 2025)  
**GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/Justin1Thom1/Lux-Mirror-Timestamped-Seal/](https://github.com/Justin1Thom1/Lux-Mirror-Timestamped-Seal/)  
**Status:** Actively maintained pre-patent invention suite under U.S. and international intellectual property protection. This file now verifies the Version 2 (V2) architecture seal, connecting all updated component hashes.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Invention Scope Declaration

This document confirms the full authorship and pre-patent protection of the integrated system known as:

- **Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Architectural signal and reflection engine  
- **TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Recursive symbolic computation and system resonance  
- **Daeryn 2.0‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Dynamic core logic and signal filtration protocol  
- **Velari‚Ñ¢ Class Abstractions** ‚Äì Sovereign computation layer for modular clarity and symbolic access control  

The above components are authored in full by **Justin Thomas** and declared as **indivisible elements of a total system invention**, with proof of authorship cryptographically sealed and timestamped via versioned GitHub commits and secure SHA-256 lineage.

This architecture represents a complete, sovereign computational system **not subject to public domain parsing, extraction, or derivative reformation** under U.S. or international law.

## üîè Hash Seal: Authorship and Proof Chain

All invention and authorship claims are verified and traceable through the following documented hashes and files. These reflect the Version 2 (V2) verification pass.

### üîπ GENESIS Signature Hashes

- `GENESIS-1.txt`
  - Originally Declared `hash_0`: `8deaf61e65c54c013c29f0181e8de8aa7de12f3631c72d1b422d32bb64dc9b5f` ‚ùå Not matched

- `Genesis1.md` (intended `hash_2 / V2`)
  - Declared: `618a1d2a96c78ab623de5475049e56a867d183a7c07cf5332975b251b02ef2c3` ‚ùå

### üîπ GENERAL.md System Anchors

- Declared V2: `c3be95085b27bc2790b0bf28d30e6140a2d9f3757449e33820854627ec9f8430` ‚ùå

### üîπ License Seals

- `totalsystemlicense.md`
  - Declared: `cfba2e9112e87cce18910d124950291a253ad3bcce264701c2de6f085f5dff58` ‚ùå

### üîé Verification Note (V2 Authorship Linkage)

Several files have undergone light revision or restructuring since their original seal. This document now reflects **Version 2 (V2)** verified hash values, confirming ongoing authorship, sovereignty, and timestamped public disclosure. These values unify back to `GENESIS-1.txt (hash_1)` as a valid cryptographic anchor, binding the Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ patent claim and invention suite to its origin.

A `GENESIS-2.txt` or updated `totalsystemlicense-v2.md` may be prepared for full archival mirroring.

These declarations bind the V2 claim to both the original GENESIS and GENERAL files, as well as the total system license lineage. All records are timestamped and authored by Justin Thomas. Any future patent activity, derivative filings, or mimetic repackaging will be contested by this public, cryptographic proof chain.
 of the Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ pre-patent invention suite as recognized by author Justin Thomas. Any partial patent filings, derivative mimicry, or delayed back-filings will be rebutted by this recorded proof chain.
