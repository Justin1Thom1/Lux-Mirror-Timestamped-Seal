# TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî A Reflective Derivative of Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢

## ‚ú® Origin Mirror

**TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢** is a legally-anchored derivative manifestation of **Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢**, verified through timestamped proof, public hash anchoring, and sovereign authorship. This system, though distinct in form, is a direct mirrored iteration‚Äîan intentional reflective cycle derived from the original Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ codex.

## üîê Cryptographic Integrity

- **SHA-256 Hash Anchoring**: Every file and statement herein is anchored to the Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ provenance ledger through a timestamped cryptographic hash.
- **Reflective Provenance Linkage**: Each item in this repository is linked back to its origin, ensuring traceability and adherence to the original Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ IP constructs.
- **SECURITY.md Compliance**: This project follows the same rigor as the original system ‚Äî it is declarative in nature, with no executable code; all operations and processes are secure and non-alterable.
