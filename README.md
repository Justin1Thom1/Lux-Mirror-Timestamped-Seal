## üîê Proof of Integrity ‚Äî Cryptographic Hash

This repository preserves the hash of the original sealed archive as cryptographic proof of authorship:

**Filename:** `Lux-Mirror-Original-Filing.pdf`  
**SHA-256 Hash:**  
`7c12840e7b58af65c59c0e7b34119c83b1c879b83ee41d784fb6a6bb3ab0cfa8`  
**Timestamp Generated:** April 19, 2025 (UTC)
**README.txt (Public Timestamped Mirror)**  
`8c2b5384048282af1f66a610d350d9648972c5741575a23ad3111e0eedf43501`

This hash ensures the immutability of the originally submitted intellectual property and protects it against tampering or unauthorized claims.

## üîí Repository Purpose

This repository is not the main project source.

It exists for one purpose only:  
**To act as a decentralized, third-party verifiable timestamp and proof-of-origin.**

The original, private Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ system is protected, enforced, and retained under controlled access only.

A patent application for Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢, including its core systems (Codex Flame‚Ñ¢, Daeryn 2.0‚Ñ¢, and Velari‚Ñ¢ Class Architect), is currently in processing.
All proprietary logic and architectures are protected under pending intellectual property rights.
