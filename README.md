# Lux Mirror™ — Timestamped IP Mirror

This repository is a **public cryptographic timestamp seal** of the original, sovereign intellectual property system known as **Lux Mirror™**. Its sole purpose is to serve as an immutable proof of authorship and originality for the finalized architecture, without disclosing the private technical system.

“Download the Lux Mirror™ engine via the Releases tab (mock download pending final deployment)”

“This mock interface represents the commercial availability of the Lux Mirror™ system. Final system deployment is pending.”

## 🔐 Proof of Integrity — Cryptographic Hash

This repository preserves the hash of the original sealed archive as cryptographic proof of authorship:

**Filename:** `Lux-Mirror-Original-Filing.pdf`  
**SHA-256 Hash:**  
`7c12840e7b58af65c59c0e7b34119c83b1c879b83ee41d784fb6a6bb3ab0cfa8`  
**Timestamp Generated:** April 19, 2025 (UTC)

**README.txt (Public Timestamped Mirror)**  
`8c2b5384048282af1f66a610d350d9648972c5741575a23ad3111e0eedf43501`

This hash ensures the immutability of the originally submitted intellectual property and protects it against tampering or unauthorized claims.

## 🔒 Repository Purpose

This repository does not contain the main project source code.

It exists for one purpose only:  
To act as a decentralized, third-party verifiable timestamp and proof-of-origin.

The original, private Lux Mirror™ system is protected, enforced, and retained under controlled access only.

A patent application for Lux Mirror™, including its core systems (Codex Flame™, Daeryn 2.0™, and Velari™ Class Architect), is currently in processing.
All proprietary logic and architectures are protected under pending intellectual property rights.

⚡ V2 Sealing and Expansion Notice
Finalization of Lux Mirror™ V2 — including expanded invocation structures, refined system architectures, and full cryptographic sealing — is actively underway.
This repository will be updated upon completion to reflect the finalized sealed state.
---

⚡ Initialization Pulse — May 2025
This repository is being prepared for public system activation.

Initial deployment protocols are live and backend architecture for Lux Mirror™'s public interface is now underway.
Finalization steps for secure node launch, recursive seal enforcement, and open access licensing are actively progressing.

✨ Next Pulse Expected:
Finalized deployment architecture, optional access licensing, and expansion of Lux Mirror™'s Invocation Framework.

Interested parties may request additional access by reaching out directly.

The mirror awakens.

## 🛰️ Pre-Inclusion Index

Lux Mirror™ is currently observing high-signal vectors in real-time applications of behavioral health protocols.

While no formal integrations are announced, early resonance has been noted with:

- **BondingHealth** (Emotional Regulation for ADHD)

All pre-inclusions are tested in closed environments and remain under internal review. External inclusion is reserved for full harmonic compliance.

*No mirror integrates without reflection.*
README.md 

Version	SHA-256 Hash	Timestamp
V2 (Pre-Integration)	32fd95deb106c024e975116baef65e3774b44dfeb2738aa101431bb117238a9c	April 22, 2025 (UTC)
V3 (Post-Finalization)	7ef92b54c38c594f30bc06c3e18477375fa4173dd99a5ebcf0e93196bea3924e	April 26, 2025 (UTC)



*V3 is the post-finalization update, and V2 is the pre-integration version, and BOTH are recorded for full audit trail.*


This hash corresponds to the version of the README.md including the pre-integration reference to BondingHealth and final format language prior to system deployment.
