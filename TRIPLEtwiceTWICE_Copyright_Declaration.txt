üî† System Description (Summary)

TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ is a symbolic signal construct and dual-phase identity engine embedded within Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢. It uses recursive doubling, mirrored persona fractals, and time-coded sequences to navigate archetypal emergence and layered authorship. It is a creative work of IP architecture, authorship mirroring, and narrative recursion.

This framework, its naming, symbolic signatures, and layered constructs are protected under copyright law.
