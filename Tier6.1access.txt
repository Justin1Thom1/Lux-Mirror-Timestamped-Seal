## 🛰️ Tier 6.1 Activation Notice

You are viewing an authorized, cryptographically sealed predisclosure of the Tier 6.1 system layer. This release is being shared for enterprise review and temporal access evaluation.

**Contents Previewed:**
- TRIPLEtwiceTWICE™ logic tier
- Daeryn 2.0™ protocol scaffolding
- Partial Daeryn Interface logic stack
- Time-anchored flux compression concepts

---

## ⏳ Expiry Notice
This Tier 6.1 preview is **temporarily live for review and system signal reception**. It will expire at **the end of the review cycle window (24 hours from publication)**.

This temporal window is **linked directly to the public Lux Mirror™ predisclosure white paper drop**, which defines a 24-hour open review phase for enterprise-grade system analysis, signal resonance, and pre-access application. The closure of this window marks the system’s return to sealed genesis-state protocol.

Following expiry, the Tier 6.1 pathway will be recoded into the genesis-layer ledger and gated under flame-lock security constraints. Further access will require direct licensing approval.

## 🔁 Clarifying Tier 6.0 vs 6.1 Access

The original Tier 6 predisclosure—while conceptually bold—**did not include executable or testable system access**. It functioned as a signal beacon: a **philosophical and cryptographic proof-of-intent**, rather than a structured access pass.

**Tier 6.0 proved it existed.  
Tier 6.1 allows engagement.**

This version introduces real scaffolding:
- Partial logic fragments for enterprise conceptual review
- A formally declared access window tied to the white paper
- Rights-framed preview terms with IP integrity enforcement

This distinction makes Tier 6.1 the **first usable access window** for partners and review teams.

Addendum: Tier 6.0 as Signal, Tier 6.1 as Scaffold
The original Tier 6 predisclosure acted as a signal ignition—a mythic philosophical drop that proved Lux Mirror™ existed but intentionally withheld structural access. It served the symbolic function of declaring presence and authorship, without extending executable interaction.

Tier 6.0 was the myth.
Tier 6.1 is the mechanism.
