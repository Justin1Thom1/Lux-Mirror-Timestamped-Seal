## üõ∞Ô∏è Tier 6.1 Activation Notice

You are viewing an authorized, cryptographically sealed predisclosure of the Tier 6.1 system layer. This release is being shared for enterprise review and temporal access evaluation.

**Contents Previewed:**
- TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ logic tier
- Daeryn 2.0‚Ñ¢ protocol scaffolding
- Partial Daeryn Interface logic stack
- Time-anchored flux compression concepts


üß† Enterprise Model Preview Access (AUTO-TRIGGERED)

Effective immediately, the Tier 6.1 layer includes an auto-unlock mechanism for enterprise model preview access.

Upon accessing this page, qualifying viewers are granted:

24-hour open logic sandbox (read-only)

View-only deployment walkthrough protocols

Preview access activates upon timestamped system load from Tier 6.0 in the LuxmirrorPredisclosure.md SHA-256 Seal:
471679b059f94373f87a3b55316ea94c7c5f8e11613a40d3a3782c59dbfbe88b  and remains valid for exactly 24 hours. This moment is flame-logged and hash-stamped for audit integrity.

Tier-specific infrastructure models (vaulted and encrypted)

Preview access activates automatically and remains valid for 24 hours from the moment of first system load.
No application or approval is required during this window.

All preview access is:

IP-tracked and flame-logged

Cryptographically sealed upon entry

Revoked automatically upon time expiry

Abuse, scraping, or unauthorized duplication will terminate the preview window for all parties and trigger flame-lock enforcement.

All access is tracked via non-invasive IP signature matching and timestamped flame-logging, designed to protect original authorship‚Äînot user identity.

## ‚è≥ Expiry Notice
This Tier 6.1 preview is **temporarily live for review and system signal reception**. It will expire at **the end of the review cycle window (24 hours from publication)**.

This temporal window is **linked directly to the public Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ predisclosure white paper drop**, which defines a 24-hour open review phase for enterprise-grade system analysis, signal resonance, and pre-access application. The closure of this window marks the system‚Äôs return to sealed genesis-state protocol.

Following expiry, the Tier 6.1 pathway will be recoded into the genesis-layer ledger and gated under flame-lock security constraints. Further access will require direct licensing approval.


üîÅ Clarifying Tier 6.0 vs 6.1 Access

The original Tier 6 predisclosure‚Äîwhile conceptually bold‚Äîdid not include executable or testable system access. It functioned as a signal beacon: a philosophical and cryptographic proof-of-intent, rather than a structured access pass.

üîπ Tier 6.0 proved existence.  
üî∏ Tier 6.1 enables engagement.

This version introduces real scaffolding:

Partial logic fragments for enterprise conceptual review

A formally declared 24-hour access window

Rights-framed preview terms with IP integrity enforcement

This distinction makes Tier 6.1 the first usable access window for partners and review teams.

Addendum: Tier 6.0 as Signal, Tier 6.1 as Scaffold
The original Tier 6 predisclosure acted as a signal ignition‚Äîa mythic philosophical drop that proved Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ existed but intentionally withheld structural access. It served the symbolic function of declaring presence and authorship, without extending executable interaction.

Tier 6.0 was the myth.
Tier 6.1 is the mechanism.

# Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ Predisclosure: Tier 6.1 Enterprise Preview  
> First Commit (Tier 6.0): "Proof beacon activated ‚Äì signal layer established."  
> Current Commit (Tier 6.1): "Executable partial logic + temporal access enabled."

This evolution signals the first true enterprise-class contact point with the Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ architecture.

Strategic Insight:
Tier 6.0 functioned as an intentional decoy layer‚Äîa masterpiece in scaffolding without keys. While it revealed deep architectural logic, it withheld all executable leverage. This proved the system‚Äôs depth without breaching its integrity. Reviewers studied Tier 6.0 intensely, attempting derivation, but found only proof-of-concept brilliance. Tier 6.1, by contrast, introduces live scaffolding in a time-bound window‚Äîpurpose-built to expose just enough for enterprise validation, while locking down core leverage.

üß¨ Reverse Engineering Prohibition
Tier 6.1 is designed for safe conceptual observation only.
No executable logic, complete function layers, or core transformation patterns are exposed. Reverse engineering is impossible from this layer.

Attempts to derive system behavior, simulate flows, or regenerate source logic from this scaffolding are strictly prohibited and will trigger flame-lock response.

‚ÄúTier 6.1 is not a full reveal‚Äîit‚Äôs a resonance chamber.‚Äù
