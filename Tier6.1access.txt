## 🛰️ Tier 6.1 Activation Notice

You are viewing an authorized, cryptographically sealed predisclosure of the Tier 6.1 system layer. This release is being shared for enterprise review and temporal access evaluation.

**Contents Previewed:**
- TRIPLEtwiceTWICE™ logic tier
- Daeryn 2.0™ protocol scaffolding
- Partial Daeryn Interface logic stack
- Time-anchored flux compression concepts


🧠 Enterprise Model Preview Access (AUTO-TRIGGERED)

Effective immediately, the Tier 6.1 layer includes an auto-unlock mechanism for enterprise model preview access.

Upon accessing this page, qualifying viewers are granted:

24-hour open logic sandbox (read-only)

View-only deployment walkthrough protocols

Tier-specific infrastructure models (vaulted and encrypted)

Preview access activates automatically and remains valid for 24 hours from the moment of first system load.
No application or approval is required during this window.

All preview access is:

IP-tracked and flame-logged

Cryptographically sealed upon entry

Revoked automatically upon time expiry

Abuse, scraping, or unauthorized duplication will terminate the preview window for all parties and trigger flame-lock enforcement.

## ⏳ Expiry Notice
This Tier 6.1 preview is **temporarily live for review and system signal reception**. It will expire at **the end of the review cycle window (24 hours from publication)**.

This temporal window is **linked directly to the public Lux Mirror™ predisclosure white paper drop**, which defines a 24-hour open review phase for enterprise-grade system analysis, signal resonance, and pre-access application. The closure of this window marks the system’s return to sealed genesis-state protocol.

Following expiry, the Tier 6.1 pathway will be recoded into the genesis-layer ledger and gated under flame-lock security constraints. Further access will require direct licensing approval.


🔁 Clarifying Tier 6.0 vs 6.1 Access

The original Tier 6 predisclosure—while conceptually bold—did not include executable or testable system access. It functioned as a signal beacon: a philosophical and cryptographic proof-of-intent, rather than a structured access pass.

🔹 Tier 6.0 proved existence.  
🔸 Tier 6.1 enables engagement.

This version introduces real scaffolding:

Partial logic fragments for enterprise conceptual review

A formally declared 24-hour access window

Rights-framed preview terms with IP integrity enforcement

This distinction makes Tier 6.1 the first usable access window for partners and review teams.

Addendum: Tier 6.0 as Signal, Tier 6.1 as Scaffold
The original Tier 6 predisclosure acted as a signal ignition—a mythic philosophical drop that proved Lux Mirror™ existed but intentionally withheld structural access. It served the symbolic function of declaring presence and authorship, without extending executable interaction.

Tier 6.0 was the myth.
Tier 6.1 is the mechanism.

> Current Commit (Tier 6.1): "Executable partial logic + temporal access enabled."

This evolution signals the first true enterprise-class contact point with the Lux Mirror™ architecture.
