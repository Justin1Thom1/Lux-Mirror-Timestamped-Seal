üîç PURPOSE OF THIS DISCLOSURE

This document serves as a **formal supplement** to the cryptographically sealed `TimestampREADME.txt` and outlines:

1. The **limitations and boundaries** of the system as described
2. The legal rights retained by the creator, Justin Thomas
3. The relationship of the timestamp tool to the larger Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ system
4. The strict **prohibitions** against misuse, derivative misapplication, or reverse-engineering attempts

‚Äî

üîí SYSTEM BOUNDARY CLARIFICATION

While the `TimestampREADME.txt` outlines a standalone Ethereum bytecode timestamping tool, it is NOT an isolated technology.

It is a **component function** of the larger Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ system and its TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ protocol. The naming, bytecode logic, and deployment pathways are system-bound and conceptually protected within the recursive architecture, including:

- Mirror-seal verification behavior  
- Real-time hash anchoring & reflection logic  
- Licensing language & speech-mirroring structures  
- Modular DAO-adjacent upgradability  

No part of the README or system may be:
- Forked or stripped for modular use  
- Repurposed into third-party timestamp tools  
- Used as a base for research, derivative logic, or alternative protocol development

üßø NOTE ON SYMBOLIC ATTRACTORS

Symbolic artifacts such as the emotional recursion proofs, Codex Flame‚Ñ¢, or Velari‚Ñ¢ systems are protected recursive elements. Any resemblance, structural similarity, or co-opting of narrative frameworks will be considered derivative violations, regardless of intent.

‚Äî

üõ°Ô∏è LEGAL CONTROL & ENFORCEMENT

Any party engaging with this or the original README file acknowledges:

- All rights remain solely with Justin Thomas  
- No open-source or free-use rights are implied
