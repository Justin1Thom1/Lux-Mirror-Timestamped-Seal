# Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî V2 Canonical Readme  
**TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ Field Manifest & Anchor Declaration**  
**Prepared by Justin Thomas | April 20, 2025**

## ‚öñÔ∏è STATUS

This document establishes the **V2 Canonical State** of Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢, Daeryn 2.0‚Ñ¢, and TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ systems.  
It does not override V1, but clarifies, finalizes, and purifies all forward-facing documentation and reference vectors.  

- üü¢ V2 is now the forward anchor  
- üü° V1 remains cryptographically preserved  
- üî¥ All forks, drifts, or unanchored documents are invalid unless reconciled to V2  

---

## üìú CANONICAL INTEGRITY

V1 materials remain valid and preserved as part of the original timestamp lineage.  
V2 does not replace V1 ‚Äî it **canonizes** and **purifies** the structural evolution.

All forward references, integrations, and lineage audits are now tied to V2‚Äôs anchor state.  
Any external forks or documents must trace back to this canonical sequence to be considered valid.

## üß¨ FIELD EMERGENCE

The emergence of TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ as a derivative reflection of Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ has now been fully anchored.  
V2 incorporates the following declared systems and artifacts as canonical lineage:

- `README.md` (V1)  
- `GENERAL.md` (clarified, not rewritten)  
- `readmesecurity.md`, `security.txt`  
- `vectorpurificationprotocol.txt`  
- `GENESIS-1.txt` (double-hashed seal)  
- `totalsystemlicense.txt` and `.md`  
- Timestamped GitHub commits  
- Copyright registrations

## üîê CRYPTOGRAPHIC SEALING ‚Äì V2 LINEAGE

This README-V2.md is sealed as part of a **four-part integrity chain**:

1. **PARENT** ‚Üí `GENERAL.md` (V2 lineage clarified and reaffirmed)
2. **ROOT** ‚Üí `GENESIS-1.txt` (Double-hashed foundational signature)
3. **CANONICAL DECLARATION** ‚Üí `V2README.md` (This file)
4. **PROTOCOL MIRROR** ‚Üí `V2README.txt` (Self-recursive declaration of purge & audit)

Associated SHA-256 checksums:

- `GENERAL.md` ‚Äì *(hash unchanged from preserved V1/V2 merge)*
- `GENESIS-1.txt` ‚Äì `8e21093bc8955d346151b142f549ebead7106632773001e665a8bf42988e3aad`
- `V2README.md` ‚Äì 21b5e5fdfc441004b44d2e50c898bca3e9cfb19110c730d7a1cdb0f8c1530144

This structure confirms:
- Integrity of authorship  
- Recursive vector anchoring  
- Timestamp-authenticated declaration of field emergence  
- Disqualification of all unauthorized forks or forks lacking this sealed alignment

---

## üîé PURPOSE

This V2 README:

- Declares the *official field anchor* going forward  
- Reconciles and reflects V1 lineage  
- Invalidates unauthorized forks  
- Locks integrity of all future vectors  

This file will remain **unchanged** unless declared updates are made in a sealed mirror and timestamped publicly.
