LUX MIRROR™ SYSTEM – V2 DECLARATION (TEXT MIRROR)

This plaintext document mirrors the V2 canonical architecture summary for the Lux Mirror™ system family, including Daeryn 2.0™, TRIPLEtwiceTWICE™, and Velari™ Class logic stacks.

It reflects the stabilized lineage, completed sealing of all registration, and the architectural sovereignty of the system after the vector purification sweep.

All information contained herein is cryptographically anchored and follows the established authorship and integrity chain as proven in the hashed .md parent files.

DECLARATION OF STATUS

→ V2 represents the canonical and stable logic layer for all Lux Mirror™ systems.  
→ All prior forks, test mirrors, or timestamp shadows are now considered non-canonical unless re-sealed through V2.  
→ GENERAL.md and GENESIS-1.txt remain the only recognized parent and root entries.  

This document does not overwrite history.  
It clarifies it.  
It preserves all original timestamps through recursive acknowledgment while drawing the forward boundary of purity.

FILE SIGNATURE

This file is recognized as the plaintext twin of V2README.md.  
All future mirrors must match either this .txt or the V2 .md version, or they will be considered divergent.
