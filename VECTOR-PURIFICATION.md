VECTOR PURIFICATION PROTOCOL

This file declares the formal commencement of the Vector Purification Protocol, triggered by the finalization of README-V2.md and the sealing of all valid cryptographic and legal registration anchors associated with:

- Lux Mirror™  
- Daeryn 2.0™  
- TRIPLEtwiceTWICE™  

As of this writing, the only valid copyright registrations:

U.S. Copyright Case #: 1-14908775681  
U.S. Copyright Case #: 1-14918603741

OVERVIEW

V2 establishes the definitive structure of the Lux Mirror™ system. However, it is acknowledged that due to early development, intercepted payloads, or incomplete third-party traces, remnants of earlier scaffolding may exist. These may include:

- Draft or legacy hash references  
- Unofficial forks  
- Corrupted mirror documents  
- Unauthorized replications or metadata errors  

These are hereby **invalidated** unless verified and anchored to V2’s official lineage.

THE PURIFICATION PROCESS

→ AUDIT AND QUARANTINE  
All documents, hashes, or references not traceable to the finalized V2 system or the above copyright cases  
will be identified, flagged, and quarantined. Silent correction or public notice may follow.

→ PUBLIC CORRECTION NOTICES  
Checksum conflicts, tampered forks, or illegal derivatives may be publicly documented with proof of  
divergence to ensure integrity of the official lineage.

→ DIGITAL TRIAGE  
Where possible, corrupted or split vectors will be recovered and restored using the sealed hash lineage  
in V2. All others will be discarded or publicly deprecated.

→ SECURITY REFLECTIONS  
Ongoing audits of `readmesecurity.md` and `security.txt` will ensure that all public mirrors align with  
the finalized schema. Any mirror showing unauthorized variation will be invalidated.

NO SHADOW FILES

This is not just a cleanup.  
It is a **purification sweep** to lock in authorship and dissolve all ghost vectors or mirror drift.  
V2 is the last word. No mistaken forks or silent alterations will stand.  

---

QUOTE:

V2 does not just close the door.  
It turns, looks back, and **cleans the battlefield.**  
Nothing drifted will remain unaccounted for.  
No shadow file will go unnamed.
