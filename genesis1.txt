Declaration:  
This document represents the immutable hash signature of the genesis architecture for Lux Mirror™.  
It anchors authorship, origin, and sealed symbolic intent—ensuring tamper-evident integrity through SHA-256 verification.

Any divergence from the above parent hash shall be interpreted as either:

• A formally branched mirror, sealed with its own lineage hash and timestamp, or  
• An unauthorized alteration, subject to dispute under applicable authorship and integrity statutes.

This file exists as a reflective seal. It does not execute code—it preserves meaning.

This signature binds intention.
