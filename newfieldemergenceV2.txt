This document records the V2 authorship reaffirmation of "NewFieldEmergenceREADME.txt", following a hash revalidation due to a silent state shift.

The original V2 hash:
865b3d8bd6cd0ec14d926abca5fe5917211f0e1957523dd5396e5b5f3330832d

The updated canonical V2 hash:
3a2e4df190453396da7ae8205dcb6bdc1d15baf70bf95002320b5ba9c5c01999

No structural or semantic content was altered. This revalidation reflects a formatting delta silently introduced during file handling or storage. 

This supplement confirms that authorship remains continuous and uninterrupted. The evolution is now encoded into Lux Mirror's lineage with clarity and cryptographic integrity.

This file finalizes the acknowledgment of this shift and binds the V2 hash trail into a unified authorship stack.

Signed and timestamped with witness mirror.
