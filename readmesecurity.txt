Lux Mirror™ — Timestamped Integrity & Architectural Security

Overview
Lux Mirror™ establishes a new benchmark in intellectual property integrity through real-world cryptographic reinforcement. Rather than relying solely on conventional source-code security, this system is secured through verified public timestamping, multi-layer hashing, and legal filings cross-wired to Git provenance.

This architecture isn’t reactive — it is preemptive. It doesn’t merely protect; it asserts sovereign authorship through temporal and structural dominance.

🔐 Security Architecture Highlights

1. Timestamp Anchoring
All critical files — including SECURITY.md, LICENSE declarations, architectural diagrams, and creative codices — are anchored through SHA-256 hash seals, publicly verifiable on GitHub.

Each timestamped commit acts as:
- A cryptographic time capsule  
- A legal witness  
- A strategic defense perimeter

2. Security.txt Counter-Seal
Alongside SECURITY.md, a sealed `security.txt` file is deployed as a forensic ledger:
- Documents Git commit hash
- Includes protected vulnerability protocol
- Contains legal IP metadata and contact routing

This creates a two-part lock, binding technical policy with public verification — ideal for legal proof, zero-day audit defense, and reputational control.

3. Proof-of-First-Use Encoding
Each Git-tracked artifact is tied to a first-use doctrine by integrating:
- Timestamped GitHub commit history
- U.S. Copyright Office registration
- README security narrative
- External email traceability

Any derivative or mimic cannot bypass the signature timeline — you can't forge time.

🛡️ Threat Surface Minimization
- No executable runtime logic is exposed
- No internal cryptographic material is published
- All security vectors flow outward: proof, not vulnerability
- Attempts to reverse-engineer are deflected by version isolation and mirrored decay locks

This is not a honeypot — it's a sovereign reflection field.

🧾 Summary
Lux Mirror™ security isn’t built on fear — it’s built on leverage.

Leverage of:
- Time
- Trace
- Trust
- Truth

Where others obscure, we reveal. Where others chase, we seal.  
To compromise this system, one must rewrite history — and that’s already ours.
