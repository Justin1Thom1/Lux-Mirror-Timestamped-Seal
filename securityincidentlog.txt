Security Incident Log ‚Äì Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ & TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢  
Forensic IP Violation Record | Authored by Justin Thomas  
Timestamped Cryptographic Integrity Seal

‚Äî‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY INCIDENT LOG: LUX MIRROR‚Ñ¢ & TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS EVENTS

This log documents repeated violations against Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ and TRIPLEtwiceTWICE‚Ñ¢ systems, including but not limited to: copyright breach, clone-based cyberattack, and trademark mimicry.

üõ°Ô∏è All intrusion attempts have been **cryptographically time-sealed** and logged via IP trace, with **full event metadata and count of recorded instances**. The Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ system includes:
‚Äî IP and signature logging of unauthorized probes
‚Äî Temporal correlation to suspicious processes
‚Äî Instance-based index of repeat vectors and clones

As of the last entry:
- All unauthorized agent signatures are captured
- IP logs from **all detected events** are archived in protected forensic format
- A running count of **intrusion attempts** is maintained internally and available under sealed disclosure

This defensive publication neutralizes attack value. Record sealed by original author Justin Thomas. Legal and forensic remedies pending.

1. Unauthorized Clone Deployments (April 18‚Äì19, 2025)
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple detections of altered Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ installer clones uploaded to GitHub
   ‚Ä¢ Attempted misdirection through mirrored filenames (e.g., ‚Äúlux-node.zip‚Äù)
   ‚Ä¢ Observed behavior: shell agents embedded into fake ‚Äúsetup‚Äù scripts
   ‚Ä¢ Legal violation: Unauthorized modification and redistribution of protected IP

2. LaunchAgent Breach Vector (April 19, 2025)
   ‚Ä¢ Background agent discovered: auto-launching daemon using speech recognition
   ‚Ä¢ Planted via cloned install masquerading as ‚ÄúLux Mirror Guardian‚Äù
   ‚Ä¢ Path of implant: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mirror.guardian.plist
   ‚Ä¢ Confirmed backdoor attempt with persistent reboot-access

3. GitHub Repository Anomalies
   ‚Ä¢ Sudden metadata pings and bot-like forks within 30 minutes of timestamped commits
   ‚Ä¢ Likely mirror scraping for early-stage patent poaching
   ‚Ä¢ Confirmed: zero timestamp violation due to SHA-256 integrity protocol

4. TOS Violation Attempts by External Labs
   ‚Ä¢ Attempts to frame integration of Lux Mirror‚Ñ¢ into closed testbeds as ‚Äúinternal R&D‚Äù
   ‚Ä¢ Communications traced to AI lab subdomains, cloaked as collaborative API interest
   ‚Ä¢ Legally nullified by prior publication and open timestamp anchoring

5. Forensic Safeguards
   ‚Ä¢ All intrusion attempts preserved as cryptographically hashed logs
   ‚Ä¢ All prior disclosures anchored via SHA-256 and GitHub commit timestamps
   ‚Ä¢ Zero risk of retroactive claim due to legally viable authorship trail

6. Live Siege Attempt Detection (April 19‚Äì20, 2025)
   ‚Ä¢ Monitored deep system scanning activity following public repo publication
   ‚Ä¢ AI-driven anomaly scanning detected activity consistent with model poisoning and mimicry
   ‚Ä¢ Prevented by memory integrity locks and isolation of hashing architecture

‚Äî

Legal Classification:  
These events constitute attempted copyright breach, clone-based cyberattack, and trademark mimicry of a registered IP.

Remedies:  
Secured timestamped trail and active defensive publication neutralizes attack value. Record sealed cryptographically.
